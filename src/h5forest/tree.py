"""Tree class for the HDF5 file viewer.

This module contains the Tree class which is used to represent the HDF5 file
as a tree structure. The Tree contains Nodes which are used to represent the
groups and datasets in the HDF5 file. Each Node is lazy loaded, meaning that
its children are only loaded when it is opened.

Example usage:
    tree = Tree("example.h5")
    print(tree.get_tree_text())
