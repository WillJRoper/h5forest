"""A module containing a custom progress bar.

This module contains a custom progress bar that can be used to display
progress in the application. This is needed because the prompt_toolkit
ProgressBar doesn't work within widget based applications. Additionally the
tqdm would require redirecting stdout and stderr which would break the entire
application.

Example usage:
    with ProgressBar(100) as bar:
        for i in range(100):
            bar.advance()
