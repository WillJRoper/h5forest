# h5forest
HDF5 Forest (`h5forest`) is a Text-based User Interface (TUI) for exploring HDF5 files.

`h5ls` works, and `h5glance` is a great improvement, so "Why bother?" I hear you ask. 

Well, `h5forest` brings interactivity and new functionality not available in its long-standing brethren. `h5forest` includes:

- An interactive interface capable of handling large files with deep hierarchies.
- Real-time metadata and attribute displays.
- A modal system for interacting with the file (I use Neovim by the way).
- Lazy loading, making the most of chunked data.
- Peeking inside Datasets.
- Computing statistics on the fly.
- Generation of quick diagnostics.
- Fully asynchronous operation for a blazingly fast (ðŸ”¥) and responsive feel.
- A fully terminal-based interface with vim motions (did I mention?...)

The following features are coming soon:
- A search function.
- Renaming of Datasets and Groups.

## Getting started

`h5forest` can be installed through `pip`:

```bash
pip install h5forest
```

You will now have the `h5forest` command installed. Simply run

```
h5forest /path/to/hdf5/file.hdf5
```

on the command line to get started exploring a file.
